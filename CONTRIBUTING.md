## Developing

### Getting started

- `npm i`
- `npm run test:output` or `npm run test:output-watch` to run scss on the test.scss file under ./tests
  - both commands will compile the test.scss file and output the result to a new create dist folder inside ./tests

### Running tests

- `npm run test` or `npm i run test:watch` will run the jest tests with [true](https://github.com/oddbird/true)
